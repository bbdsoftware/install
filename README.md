### Installer

This is a script for download binary from Github Release and install in your computer.

For a long time, I wrote a lot of tools and released them on Github Release, but I had to write an installation script for each tool.

This took me a lot of time and did a lot of repetitive work.

So I decided to write a universal script, which applies to all repo.

It needs to meet the following format `{name}_{os}_{arch}.tar.gz`

eg.

```
whatchanged_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
whatchanged_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
whatchanged_freebsd_amd64.tar.gz
whatchanged_windows_amd64.tar.gz
...
```

### 1. Shell (Mac/Linux)

install latest version

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bbdsoftware/install/raw/v1/install.sh | bash -s -- -r={owner}/{repo}
```

install specified version

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bbdsoftware/install/raw/v1/install.sh | bash -s -- -r={owner}/{repo} -v={version}
```

specified the executable filename name

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bbdsoftware/install/raw/v1/install.sh | bash -s -- -r={owner}/{repo} -e={exe}
```

install from a `Github Mirror` website (Very helpful if you got network trouble to accessing Github). see [forward-cli](https://github.com/axetroy/forward-cli)

```bash
# setup revers proxy
$ forward --proxy-external https://github.com
2022/01/26 16:52:42 Proxy 'http://192.168.4.105:80' to 'https://github.com'
# install
$ curl -fsSL http://192.168.4.105/bbdsoftware/install/raw/v1/install.sh | bash -s -- -r=release-lab/whatchanged -g=http://192.168.4.105
```

### 2. PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
$r="{owner}/{repo}";iwr https://github.com/bbdsoftware/install/raw/v1/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

install specified version

```powershell
$r="{owner}/{repo}";$v="{version}";iwr https://github.com/bbdsoftware/install/raw/v1/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

specified the executable filename name

```bash
$r="{owner}/{repo}";$e="{exe}";iwr https://github.com/bbdsoftware/install/raw/v1/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

install from a `Github Mirror` website (Very helpful if you got network trouble to accessing Github). see [forward-cli](https://github.com/axetroy/forward-cli)
